# 🧀 chi-coding-lab

A personal coding lab where I grow into JavaScript and web development through freeCodeCamp, building clean code and thoughtful habits, and making sure every bug passes my test cases before it gets to stay.

## 🎯 Goals

* Build strong foundations in **JavaScript**
* Practice problem-solving through real coding challenges
* Write clean, readable, and well-structured code
* Track my learning progress over time
* Celebrate small wins when something finally works 🎉

## 📘 What I’m Learning

I’m currently following the **freeCodeCamp JavaScript curriculum (v9)** and working through hands-on challenges that cover:

* **JavaScript Fundamentals** — variables, data types, operators, and core syntax
* **Control Flow & Logic** — conditionals (`if/else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`)
* **Functions & Scope** — reusable functions, arrow functions, and understanding scope
* **Arrays & Objects** — working with structured data and collections
* **String & Number Methods** — built-in methods for data manipulation
* **ES6+ Features** — `let`, `const`, arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals
* **Debugging & Problem Solving** — identifying bugs and improving algorithmic thinking
* **Basic DOM Concepts** — understanding how JavaScript interacts with web pages

## 🧰 What I’m Using

* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **Git & GitHub** for version control
* **Markdown** for documentation

## 🚀 How I Use This Repo

* Each folder contains practice exercises and solutions from freeCodeCamp
* I add notes to explain concepts in my own words (future me will thank present me)
* I revisit old code to refactor, improve readability, and apply new techniques as I learn more
