# 🧀 chi-coding-lab

A personal coding lab where I practice freeCodeCamp exercises, document my learning process, and strengthen my web development and JavaScript skills with a quality-first mindset — because even my bugs deserve proper testing 😆.

## 🎯 Goals

* Build strong foundations in **JavaScript**.
* Practice problem-solving through real coding challenges.
* Write clean, readable, and well-structured code.
* Track my learning progress over time.

## 📘 What I’m Learning

I’m currently following the **freeCodeCamp JavaScript curriculum (v9)** and working through hands-on challenges that cover:

* **JavaScript Fundamentals** — variables, data types, operators, and core syntax.
* **Control Flow & Logic** — conditionals (`if/else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`).
* **Functions & Scope** — reusable functions, arrow functions, and understanding scope.
* **Arrays & Objects** — working with structured data and collections.
* **String & Number Methods** — built-in methods for data manipulation.
* **ES6+ Features** — `let`, `const`, arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals.
* **Debugging & Problem Solving** — identifying bugs and improving algorithmic thinking.
* **Basic DOM Concepts** — understanding how JavaScript interacts with web pages.

## 🧰 What I’m Using

* **JavaScript (ES6+)**.
* **Git & GitHub** for version control.
* **Markdown** for documentation.

## 🚀 How I Use This Repo

* Each folder contains practice exercises and solutions from freeCodeCamp.
* I add notes to explain concepts in my own words (future me will thank present me).
* I revisit old code to refactor, improve readability, and apply new techniques as I learn more.
